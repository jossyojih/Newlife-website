      The Mustard Seed ‘NELIREF’
    </h2>
    <section class="about-us-AI">
      <p class="about-us-content">
        New Life Research Foundation is a Vision that came in 2013 and submitting it to his discipler, Pastor Dr.
        Ezekiel Hanior, Pastor Hanior prophesied in 2013 that this vision would
        transcend denominational boundaries and have a global impact beyond the confines of a church building. He
        offered
        prayers for its manifestation in due time. During the protracted 6-month Academic Staff Union of Universities
        (ASUU)
        strike in Nigeria, the Visionary (Joseph Luper
        Tsenum) spent the six-month strike seeking the Lord to discover his purpose for living. It was then that he read
        a book written by Bro. Gbile Akanni titled ‘The Journey into
        Your
        Vision’. This brought insight to him and the subsequent vision to form New Life Research to mobilize God’s
        children in and into
        different nations for revival using academics, research, and scholarships. It is worthy of note that this name
        New Life
        Research was received in 2013 as well. New Life Research Foundation is for those who have this new life in
        Christ and those who will come to have this new life in Christ whom the Lord will be using in different nations
        for revival using academics and research. Jer. 1:1-19, 51:20-24 is
        the
        anchor scripture for New Life Research Foundation as the Lord promised to use anyone He wills to bring down
        revival in
        the nations. <br> <br>
        On October 23, 2017, the Lord came again speaking to our brother on the need to start taking the ‘initiation
        step’ into
        the nations. He created a page on Facebook on that day and called a few brethren together whom they prayed and
        started
        the work. While few people believed in the Vision, some did not believe in it from the onset (probably because
        it was a
        mustard seed and himself was not yet into the nations he spoke to them about). In the same 2017, few members he
        was
        working with got scholarships and traveled to Europe while he was still in Nigeria.
        <br> <br>
        After applying for a scholarship in Europe in 2018 and securing it in 2019, he traveled to Russia for his
        Masters
        program and by then, more people believed in the Vision (The mustard seed NELIREF). New Life Research Foundation
        was
        formally launched on November 22, 2019.
        <br> <br>
        The mustard seed ‘NELIREF’ was incorporated in Nigeria as a Christian Academic/Research non-profit organization
        on March
        2, 2022 and in Georgia, United States on May 17, 2023.
        <br> <br>
        New Life Research Foundation now has more than 15, 000 followers on social media platforms.
        Under this time, 100s of NELIREF members secured scholarships in different nations. New Life Research Foundation
        have conducted programs such as Pioneer Research Cohort, Trainings, Annual Conference,
        Scholarship Webinars, Social Media Evangelism, Follow-up & Discipleship, Mission Challenge & Scholars’
        Interaction,
        Accelerated Mentorship Program for First Class and Distinction Undergraduate and Graduate Applicants, and
        NELIREF
        Connect in different parts of the world. Together with its partners such as The United
        Pentecostal Church (UPCI), Adullam Calvary Mission, Makurdi Christian Youth Summit, Ngunan Addingi Mentorship
        Program,
        The Moscow Goodnews Church and other research labs in North America, NELIREF is dedicated to counseling and
        mentoring
        its members to become sharp arrows in God’s quiver in the nations.
        <br> <br>
        Indeed, the Lord can use anything, the mustard seed NELIREF is set to become a big umbrella where both
        believers in
        Jesus and unbelievers can come to drink from the living water and discover their purpose for living.

      The Power of Sustainable Research, Machine Learning and Artificial
      Intelligence
    </h2>
    <section class="about-us-AI">
      <div class="remove-sm-screen">
        <img src="../Assets/Homepage/ai.jpg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p class="about-us-content">
        Recent advances in research, wherein scientists formulate hypotheses and meticulously derive conclusive results,
        have elevated humanity above other species. The standard of living has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory
        across successive centuries. The advent of the scientific and technological revolution has yielded therapeutic
        interventions for once deemed incurable ailments. Additionally, domains encompassing habitation, transportation,
        agricultural breeding, sustainable energy, telecommunications, electronics, among others, have experienced
        substantial advancements in the 21st century.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the preceding decade, the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has wrought transformative effects on fields
        including medicine, healthcare, agriculture, communication, marketing, speech recognition, and autonomous
        vehicular systems, among numerous others. Notably, the introduction of DeepMind's AlphaFold has demonstrated
        AI's prowess in addressing one of the most formidable challenges in human tasks: protein structure prediction.
        Within the realm of AI, key branches include Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
        Machine learning, in turn, is bifurcated into supervised learning (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector
        Machines) and unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, principal component analysis) and Deep Learning (e.g.,
        neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks).
        <br />
        <br />
        <span>
          While strides in NLP have successfully extracted meaning from vast text datasets, the emergence of
          Transformers
          and Transfer Learning portends even greater achievements in the ensuing decade. Innovations such as OpenAI's
          ChatGPT and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) hold significant promise across diverse sectors, including
          the domains of medicine and healthcare.
          <br />
          <br />
          To comprehend the intricacies of algorithms and elucidate the workings of 'Black Box' models, there is an
          imperative for the development and adoption of Explainable and Interpretable AI/ML methodologies, exemplified
          by
          techniques like LIME, SHAP, Anchors, and other novel approaches. Given the present state of most ML models,
          achieving a statistically sound interpretation of each feature's contribution to the model remains a
          formidable
          challenge, exacerbated by the inherent complexity of these algorithms, which presents a substantial barrier to
          comprehending and interpreting such models.
